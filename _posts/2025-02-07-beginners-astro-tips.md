## Beginner Astro Tips

Starting out in astrophotography? Here are some essentials:

1. **Stable Mount**: Invest in a solid equatorial mountâ€”it's more critical than your scope.
2. **Accurate Polar Alignment**: Minimizes star trails, crucial for longer exposures.
3. **Begin with Bright Targets**: Orion Nebula or Andromeda are great first choices.
4. **Use Calibration Frames**: Flats, darks, biases remove artifacts and improve quality.

With patience and practice, you'll see rapid improvements in your images.
