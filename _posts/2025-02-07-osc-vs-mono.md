## OSC vs. Mono Cameras

**One-Shot Color (OSC)** cameras capture color data in a single exposure. **Monochrome** cameras need filters for LRGB or narrowband, but can offer higher sensitivity.

### Which is Best?

- **OSC**: Easy setup, less gear, faster captures.
- **Mono**: Better detail and narrowband performance.

Choose based on your workflow, budget, and imaging goals!
