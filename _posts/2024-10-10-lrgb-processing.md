## LRGB Processing

Combining Luminance, Red, Green, and Blue channels is a powerful way to capture high-quality astrophotos.

- **Luminance** carries your finest detail.  
- **RGB** provides rich color data.  

After calibrating each channel, align & stack them. Then combine in software (PixInsight, AstroPixelProcessor, etc.) for a vibrant, detailed final image.

> Pro tip: Keep your L channel well-exposed to maximize detail, and use shorter exposures in RGB if needed.
